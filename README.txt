Programming Language Used: C++

Execution:     



To complete this project outside of the classroom time, we would communicate over Slack. Slack is a workspace chat channel specified for the Computer Science industry. Occasionally through text as well. We met after class twice to go over code we did not understand. Overall, it was well planned teamwork and it resulted in working code, intended design, and functioning output. 

Memory Map Data structure used: 
  -A "Page" struct was created with 5 integer fields to hold the page's: start address, end address, process id, page number, arrival time 
 and completion time.
 - A vector of page structs was created and (memory size/page size) number of entries were initialized into the vector to simulate a dynamically allocated multidimensional array without the need for pointer use.After the initialization no further pages were added to the vector.
